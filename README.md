```
# IDEAL TECH STACK

```
# SETUP 
- Configure all files within /config accordingly. 
- Character settings for threads and replies can also be tinkered with in /internal/handlers/board.go.
- Salt generation for tripcodes must also be configured in models/post.go.
- Copy the exact table structure in db.sql.
- Disallow directory viewing for /templates when in production
